      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hey, my name is Branden Hansen. Currently I work at Thumbtack as a Senior Customer Success Manager. I've worked at Thumbtack for over 2 years now and came from eBay where I was a Program Account Manager. I graduated from the Art Institute of Salt Lake City with a degree in Graphic Design freelance design sometimes on the side. I have two dogs, Winston and Wilfred. Winston is a Great Pyrenees and Wilfred is a Newfoundland</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Currently I live in Saratoga Springs, Utah. I grew up in Sandy, Utah and went to Jordan High School.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I'm a pretty avid gamer. I typically play Overwatch and World of Warcraft. I also enjoy photography when I can, as well as travelling.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job would be working as photographer for a company like National Geographic. Close follow up would be working with a company like Blizzard helping to implement new and innovative technologies/ideas.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I recently built a house in Saratoga Springs, Utah.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I want to be a web developer so that I can impact how users interact with a site, be able to make meaningful impact within a business, and understand the intricacies of the majority of the languages. By being a web developer, I believe it will give me the foundations to learn additional languages like C# and Python, which will have practical implications at my current job, as well as my future job.</p>
